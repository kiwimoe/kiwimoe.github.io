## What is GitHub?

If you're new to GitHub a little intro would be helpful. GitHub is a code hosting platform for open source projects, it was founded by [blank] and accured by Microsoft in [blank]. It's now most popular open source project hosting site, 

## Why you shall not use GitHub?

When GitHub is great on it's own, it most likely was great until 2019. After getting popular GitHub started to changes stuff a lot, therefore they've also changed their old planning about limited private repos within a budget, now GitHub allows unlimited public and private repos without any monthly cost. (This is also a reason why they suddenly earned so much popularity) With this new feature many developers attracted with GitHub and now what GitHub is right now.

In every year they've added some new features and not all features were great, for example GitHub recently added GitHub codespace which is completely paid, (GitHub codespace is an online VSCode IDE). It sounds cool but GitHub wasn't made for this. They already have an online IDE for each repository (open a repo and press "." to open VSCode web version or go to github.dev and select your repository).
This truely made GitHub bloated, as like others, I'm not and never be comfortable code editing in browser it doesn't matter how much performace they're going to give, rest of wouldn't bother with it, therefore this feature became useless. I don't know does they ever care about.

About two days ago, GitHub added achivements feature. Achivement feature is like a badge or icon which will be on your profile according your activity on GitHub.

* Pull Shark: Whenever you'll create 2 or pull requests, GitHub will add a pull shark badge on your profile.
* Galaxy Brain: Answering 2 or more discussition questions will give you this badge.
* YOLO: If you merged a pull request without reviewing it, GitHub will add a YOLO badge on your profile.

Note: Any previous pull request, discussition answer, merge without review will also give you the badge.

Now let's jump to the actual point, what is the oroblem with the badges or icons? If you understand how today's world works you may already know the answer, the terms of usage of this words aren't professional, "Pull Shark", "Galaxy Brain" and "YOLO" doesn't make any sense of anything that can be particularly identify. In 2020 GitHub additionally added a badge which was for GitHub 2020 archive program and the badge name was "Arctic Code Valut". If you compare it with above mentioned badges you'll find that those one uses quite informal words which none of like (except those who're web developers and compare themselves as Software Engineer).

Term "Pull Shark" word, I don't know what to say as I don't have an idea what it points, "Galaxy Brain" again what does it sounds like their brain is Galaxy? Is programming everything in this galaxy? and last one "YOLO" is a slang. It rarely being used while chatting. 
In fact except those crappy meanings, this badges can increase spam PRs and merge without a review what they've changed. This badges not only stay for to show you got a "useless" stuff but also it've 2x, 3x, 4x tiers. This will increase by the count of PRs. You created 2 PRs you got the badge, you created 16 PRs you got a 2x sign on your badge and so on.

I don't know what does they even do, and me like never going to check where they did PR and how popular the repo was. Having a readme for your profile is enough to know about you, with some worthless badge and readme and other junks made GitHub more like a social gathering site rather than a open source code hosting platform.

## Alternatives never be good, why?

GitHub alternatives like GitLab (most popular competitor of GitHub), BitBucket and more others are never be a good alternative of GitHub. As I told before GitHub is now the most popular amoung students, teachers, developers and other folks. It's a heart of open source right now days. The reasons are obvious GitHub have a lot more feature than GitLab, (GitHub supports a huge list of programming languages and CI or simply GitHub actions). It's easy to use, much more customizable than GitLab and more importantly it's faster than GitLab and their easy to use management dashboard makes more comfortable to handle each job.

GitHub also have a feature called sponsorship on profile. It's like a button (in web language, a but-component) which allows other developers to help a particular developer by donating couple bucks per month.
 
I've never used BitBucket, have no idea but I suppose they don't have any CI feature (yet?).

## What I can use instead GitHub?

Even most of alternatives aren't good enough to override GitHub, still I'd suggest to try GitLab. It's the only most popular alternative of GitHub. But it's not that much popular in newbies. And for sponsorship, I'd suggest to try "buymeacoffee" and "patreon" (search them). They're the best alternative or another way to get sponsors for a particular project or a person.

Or if you don't want to try GitLab, I'd suggest to check self hosted git. Just search (self hosted git), the program itself written in Golang and have complete features like a older version of GitHub (like was 2012 or so). If you don't want to host it by yourself, you may try some already running instances, for example gaygit [(gitunix.lgbt)].

I know that these all alternatives are quite barebones. So far there's only some alternatives exist for now, since GitHub is closed source there's no way to get the same like GitHub hosted by a community. Thank you for reading, have a sweet day!
